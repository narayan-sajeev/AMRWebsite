                    <h3>What is the objective of this project?</h3>
                    <p>The project aims to assess and mitigate food safety risks in wholesale and wet markets in China,
                        correlating these risks with zoonotic disease outbreaks using machine learning and data analysis.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>How is machine learning used in this project?</h3>
                    <p>Machine learning algorithms are employed to develop risk scores for individual markets based on
                        historical food safety data, helping identify high-risk areas susceptible to zoonotic diseases.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>What methodologies are used for data collection?</h3>
                    <p>The project aggregates and preprocesses over 4 million food safety test records from China's
                        Administration for Market Regulation (AMR) using comprehensive clustering and regression analysis.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>How are market-level risk scores calculated?</h3>
                    <p>Risk scores are computed based on failure rates from AMR tests, specifically targeting markets with
                        significant animal product volumes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>What are the expected outcomes of this project?</h3>
                    <p>The project aims to provide actionable tools for policymakers, enhance food safety regulations, and
                        improve public health measures against zoonotic diseases in Chinese markets.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>How can the project results benefit public health?</h3>
                    <p>By identifying high-risk markets and providing evidence-based insights, the project contributes to
                        proactive measures against zoonotic disease transmission, crucial for public health management.</p>
